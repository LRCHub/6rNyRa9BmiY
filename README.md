[00:07.42] I wanna dance till my legs break
[00:13.96] I wanna love till my heart aches
[00:21.22] I want the cause of my death to be amazing sex
[00:28.41] And the love with my last breath
[00:33.22] Let's grow old and die young
[00:39.73] Let's grow old and die young
[00:47.44] We ain't down, the best is yet to come
[00:53.50] Let's grow old and die young
[01:02.43] All the nights we were wasted
[01:08.48] Not a minute was wasted
[01:16.31] I want the cause of my death to be amazing sex
[01:22.90] That I'll never forget again
[01:27.84] Let's grow old and die young
[01:34.58] Let's grow old and die young
[01:42.10] We ain't down, the best is yet to come
[01:48.07] Let's grow old and die young
[01:56.82] Whoa, whoa
[02:02.12] (Let's grow old)
[02:03.42] Whoa, whoa
[02:05.40] (And die young)
[02:10.00] Slow, they say
[02:12.60] Our days are numbers on the page
[02:17.60] Can take our youth away
[02:22.50] Let's grow old and die young
[02:29.07] Let's grow old and die young (and die young)
[02:37.30] We ain't down, the best is yet to come
[02:43.00] Let's grow old and die young
[02:50.76] Whoa, whoa
[02:57.09] (Let's grow old)
[02:58.51] Whoa, whoa
[03:00.23] (And die young)
[03:04.59] We ain't down, the best is yet to come
[03:10.22] Let's grow old and die young
